    <!-- Base application theme. -->


    <!--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        Note! The Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar is not working for everything
        because the Action Bar is deprecated. We'll leave this here for now by adding
         Base in front of it and it should work. However, we will be changing to using
         Toolbar in the near future (I just want a commit that works for everyone).
